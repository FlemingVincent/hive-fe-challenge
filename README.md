# HiveAi Frontend Engineer Challenge

## Objective

Using React or vanilla (plain) Javascript, build a reusable dropdown menu component. Please
do not use a pre-built dropdown from a component library. We expect you to build this from
scratch.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <>
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Requirements

### Design and Interface

- [x] A user should be able to open and close the dropdown menu.
- [x] The component must support a single selected option or multiple selected options.
      Please demonstrate both use cases separately.
- [x] A user should be able to select and deselect all options at once.
- [x] The selected option or options must be visible when the dropdown is closed.

Notes:

- You are encouraged to include any additional features that you believe are semantically or aesthetically crucial to a dropdown component
- Your component does not need to look identical to the designs above.

### API (via Component Props)

- [x] The component should support both single select and multi select.
- [x] The component should have a flexible API, making it reusable across different parts of
      one or more applications. Consider it part of a component library.

### Performance

- [x] The component should render large lists efficiently.
- [x] The component should not perform excessive computations.

### Readability

- [x] The code should be readable and a fellow developer should be able to dive right into
      your code.

## After You Are Done

- [x] Please email your recruiter with either a zip file of your project folder or a github link to the project directory
- [x] Donâ€™t forget to include instructions on how to run your project
- [x] Please DO NOT include a node_modules directory as part of your submission.
